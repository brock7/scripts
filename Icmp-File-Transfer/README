Icmp File Transfer -- Send files using ICMP as the transport protocol. (ICMP/IP)


USAGE:
  icmp.py recv <destination file>
  icmp.py send <file to transfer> <remote address>


DESCRIPTION:
  Icmp File Transfer is a simple tool to test if a network user can exfiltrate
  information without being noticed using ICMP. It uses the data field of the
  ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets in order to hide this information.   


COMMANDS
  recv: 
    Listens for ICMP packets and tries to assemble them into a file and store it
    on <destination file> path. At this point it cannot discern if a received 
    packet is from a file transmission or not, so if it receives normal ICMP 
    packets it can fail to assemble the file, this should be fixed on a future
    release.
 
  send:
    Reads <file to transfer> and sends it to <remote address> using the ICMP/IP
    stack.
