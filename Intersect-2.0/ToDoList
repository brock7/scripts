Intersect 2.0 To-Do List


* Implement port-scanning after live-hosts are found
* Rewrite software fingerprints and locatons for getProtection() feature
* SNMP Scanner/Enum
* Create traceroute graph for NetworkMap()
* Fix the getGateway process. Right now, we assume you are using 192.168.1.0/24. New process will pull the gateway
  from ifconfig using your local IP, drop the last octet and add .0/24 to grab your gateway.
* Add process that dumps the plain-text from memory and sends to .txt file
* Write custom client to interact with --bind listener
* Optionally send NetworkMap() output to be imported within Metasploit DB
