Added: Semi-interactive TCP bind shell. The shell binds to the server port 443 and accepts connects via netcat.
You can read files, make/delete folders, add user accounts, view processes, netstat, etc.
I am soon adding a new custom shell that will bind over SSL and you will have a wide variety of features, such as live sniffing
and the capability of running Intersect commands over the shell and installing add-on modules.

Madechanges to how Intersect searches for installed packages, log files and running services.
Added option to identify different Linux distro's and perform some of the searches as being specific to that distro.
Eventually I will incorporate the distro-specific searches into all the other areas.

and present the user with a list of local privilege escalation exploits for that kernel. The list includes the CVE number, download link
and the name of the exploit.
Added a few features to the TCP shell.
