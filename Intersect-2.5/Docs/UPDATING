How To Update:

*coming soon*


Updates Schedule:

New features, bug fixes and upgrades are constantly being pushed to
the Intersect Github repository. I will do my best to make sure that every
Monday morning, there is a stable release available. The stable release will
be listed under the 'master' branch and any developmental and beta upgrades
will be listed under the 'development' branch.

Every Monday morning, you can update to the latest stable release by using
the command 'git pull master' from your main Intersect directory.

For the beta release use 'git pull development'
