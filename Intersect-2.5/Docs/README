[ Description ]

Intersect 2.5 is the second major release in the project line. This release is much different from the previous,
in that it gives the user complete control over which features the Intersect script includes and lets them easily
import their own features, among other new functionality. 

This release focuses mainly on the individual modules(features) and the capability to generate your own customized
Intersect scripts. By using the Create.py application, the user is guided through a menu-driven process which allows
them to select which modules they would like to include, import their own custom modules and ultimately create an
Intersect script that is built around the specific modules they choose.



[ Modules ]

A module is simply a specific post-exploitation function. Each individual module itself is not capable of stand-alone
execution until it is imported with the Create application and built into a custom script.
With Intersect 2.5, there is the arrival of many new modules and some changes to the original features that were included
in version 2.0.

The modules are broken down into two categories.
The first category, Standard Modules, includes all of the original Intersect 2.0 features and tasks but they are
separated into individual modules to provide more control over the finalized custom script.
For example, the credential gathering feature is now it's own module called "creds" and
the network information gathering feature is a separate module called "network".

The second category is the Custom modules and includes anything that was not part of Intersect 2.0 and is also where
any new, additional or custom modules that the user imports will be stored. While the user can import any module
functionality they wish, the Custom modules packaged with Intersect 2.5 focus on post-exploitation automation, remote
shell access and various data exfiltration functions.

For more information on writing your own modules or importing modules for use, see the Writing-Modules documentation.



[ Creation Process ]

The Create.py application is used to generate the actual Intersect script that you will be using on the target system.
There is no final Intersect script until you make one!

When you start Create, you will be presented with a series of menus that provides the following features:
* Generate custom Intersect scripts
  -- choose as many or as few modules as you want
  -- define specific variables (i.e., shell ports and hosts, crypto keys, proxy ports, etc)
  -- view, add or remove modules from the queue
  -- view description and information on any given module
* Import custom modules
  -- download and import from a url
  -- import from a local directory
* Download Intersect 2.5 updates
  -- requires Git to be installed locally
  -- useful for bug fixes, new features, etc
* Various help menus and lots of other commands

You will be asked to give your newly created script a name. Enter the filename, without the Python file extension, when
you are prompted. Your final script will be saved in the Scripts directory.
