Important! This module has not been fully tested so there may be some bugs. If you find anything wrong with this, please let me know.

Instructions:

When you build your custom Intersect script, you will be asked to define a Remote Host (your XML servers IP) and a Remote Port (the XML servers port).
Make sure you start crackserver.py with the correct host and port information before you attempt to run XMLCrack on the target host side.

Edit the crack.cfg file to suit you specific needs. There are instructions within crack.cfg that explain how you should do this.

1) Start your CrackServer.py XMLRPC server
2) Run "./Script.py --xmlcrack filename hashtype" on the target system
3) The target system will open an XMLRPC connection to the system running CrackServer.py
4) The target system will serve up the specified file and the specified hash type
5) The CrackServer will use Crack.py and Crack.cfg to attempt to crack the hashes within the specified file
